[img]https://i.imgur.com/uQ9vY3w.jpg[/img]
5 Base game Trinkets
1 CoM Trinket
2 CC Trinkets

Mod Support for Sunward Isles &amp; Pets. Which require the respective mods installed for them to appear. I hope these trinkets coax you into giving them both a try.

To clarify, the pet will increase the rate of craving with the crimson curse, while using both will still have increased curse craving. Just not as much.
In addition, equipping Flandre will have her follow The Maid around!

[h1]Possibly Asked Questions[/h1]
[quote][i]&quot;I do not have (CC/SI/etc) installed, will this mod still work?&quot;[/i][/quote]
Yes it&apos;s compatible with these, but does not require them.

[quote][i]&quot;I used The World and I did not get my extra action, why?&quot;[/i][/quote]
With all the hours I spent testing the mod and slapping the living shit out of The World button, I&apos;ve done what I could to fix this before release. If this still occurs somehow for you, please let me know with as much information about it&apos;s occurance as you can. Sadly as I cannot change the game&apos;s engine itself, I may not be able to completely fix it.

[quote][i]&quot;Are you making other Touhou Class mods?&quot;[/i][/quote]
Yes I am! Please join my discord, [url=https://discord.gg/PhwGZnu]The Gensokyo Crypt[/url], to follow development of my next class mod, argue who is best girl; give any feed back/bug reports.

[quote][i]&quot;Will this class mod change dodge to graze?&quot;[/i][/quote]
Nope, that isn&apos;t included in the mod incase anyone didn&apos;t want a base string changed. If you do want it changed to graze, I&apos;ve uploaded it seperately. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2207613053]Here[/url]

[quote][i]&quot;Is this an anime mod?&quot;[/i][/quote]
Touhou is a videogame.

[quote][i]&quot;There are no problems.&quot;[/i][/quote]
Then please enjoy.

Random Crash-to-desktop with Yin-Yang Orb animation
-Not 100% sure how to force it to happen
-Only happens when first entering a dungeon
-Crash occurs when Orb finishes Onset animation and would begin Idle animation
-Happens less often than it not happening
-Sometimes will crash in succession, 2 to 3 reloads, then is just fine after that and doesn't crash
